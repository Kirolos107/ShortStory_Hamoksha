Hello my friends! ✨️

"I have recently completed a funny small project using an Atmega32 microcontroller, It is a short story about a great person called “Hamoksha”. It was a funny challenge to apply my knowledge in embedded systems.

In this project, I tried to access different positions on LCD to draw different patterns like (Persons, Gun, etc..) also using some delays to make some animations!
I won't explain too much, just enjoy the story!

Hardware Components:-
1. LCD 


Software Layers:-

1- MCAL => DIO

2- HAL => LCD (4 Bit Mode).
